# PlantPal

This is a drag and drop game where the player interacts with a "Plant Pal" by watering it, giving it sunlight and dressing it up with accessories. I used Unity Game Engine for all the game functionality and the code base is in C#. The final game can be played here: https://simmer.io/@dabadabadaba/plant-pal
